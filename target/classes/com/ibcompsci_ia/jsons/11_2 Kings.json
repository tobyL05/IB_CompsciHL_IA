        "22:19 Because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before Jehovah when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants, that they would become a desolation and a curse, and you have torn your clothes and wept before Me, I also have heard you, declares Jehovah.\n",
        "22:20 Therefore I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace; and your eyes will not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought back word to the king.\n"

        "22:18 Tetapi kepada raja Yehuda, yang telah menyuruh kamu untuk meminta petunjuk Tuhan, harus kamu katakan demikian: Beginilah firman Tuhan, Allah Israel: Mengenai perkataan yang telah kaudengar itu,\n",
        "22:19 oleh karena engkau sudah menyesal dan engkau merendahkan diri di hadapan Tuhan pada waktu engkau mendengar hukuman yang Kufirmankan terhadap tempat ini dan terhadap penduduknya, bahwa mereka akan mendahsyatkan dan menjadi kutuk, dan oleh karena engkau mengoyakkan pakaianmu dan menangis di hadapan-Ku, Aku pun telah mendengarnya, demikianlah firman Tuhan,\n",
        "22:20 sebab itu, sesungguhnya Aku akan mengumpulkan engkau kepada nenek moyangmu, dan engkau akan dikebumikan ke dalam kuburmu dengan damai, dan matamu tidak akan melihat segala malapetaka yang akan Kudatangkan atas tempat ini. Lalu mereka menyampaikan jawab itu kepada raja.\n"

Tidak ada barang yang tidak diperlihatkan Hizkia kepada mereka di istananya dan di seluruh daerah kekuasaannya.\n",

        "20:15 Lalu tanyanya lagi: Apakah yang telah dilihat mereka di istanamu? Jawab Hizkia: Semua yang ada di istanaku telah mereka lihat. Tidak ada barang yang tidak kuperlihatkan kepada mereka di perbendaharaanku.\n",
        "20:16 Lalu Yesaya berkata kepada Hizkia: Dengarkanlah firman Tuhan!\n",
        "20:17 Sesungguhnya, suatu masa akan datang, bahwa segala yang ada dalam istanamu dan yang disimpan oleh nenek moyangmu sampai hari ini akan diangkut ke Babel. Tidak ada barang yang akan ditinggalkan, demikianlah firman Tuhan.\n",
        "20:18 Dan dari keturunanmu yang akan kauperoleh, akan diambil orang untuk menjadi sida-sida di istana raja Babel.\n",
