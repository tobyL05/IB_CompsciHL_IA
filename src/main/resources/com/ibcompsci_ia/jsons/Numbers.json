          "35:6 Mengenai kota-kota yang harus kamu berikan kepada orang Lewi itu, ialah enam kota perlindungan yang harus kamu berikan, supaya orang pembunuh dapat melarikan diri ke sana; di samping itu haruslah kamu memberikan empat puluh dua kota.\n",
          "35:7 Segala kota yang harus kamu berikan kepada orang Lewi itu berjumlah empat puluh delapan kota, semuanya dengan tanah-tanah penggembalaannya.\n",

          "35:22 Tetapi jika ia sekonyong-konyong menumbuk orang itu dengan tidak ada perasaan permusuhan, atau dengan tidak sengaja melemparkan sesuatu benda kepadanya,\n",
          "35:23 atau dengan kurang ingat menjatuhkan kepada orang itu sesuatu batu yang mungkin menyebabkan matinya seseorang, sehingga orang itu mati, sedangkan dia tidak merasa bermusuh dengan orang itu dan juga tidak mengikhtiarkan celakanya,\n",
          "35:24 maka haruslah rapat umat mengadili antara orang yang membunuh itu dan penuntut darah, menurut hukum-hukum ini,\n",
          "35:25 dan haruslah rapat umat membebaskan pembunuh dari tangan penuntut darah, dan haruslah rapat umat mengembalikan dia ke kota perlindungan, ke tempat ia telah melarikan diri; di situlah ia harus tinggal sampai matinya imam besar yang telah diurapi dengan minyak yang kudus.\n",
          "35:26 Tetapi jika terjadi bahwa pembunuh itu keluar dari batas kota perlindungan, tempat ia melarikan diri,\n",
          "35:27 dan penuntut darah mendapat dia di luar batas kota perlindungannya, dan penuntut darah membunuh pembunuh itu, maka tidaklah ia berhutang darah,\n",
          "35:28 sebab pembunuh itu wajib tinggal di kota perlindungan sampai matinya imam besar, tetapi sesudah matinya imam besar bolehlah pembunuh itu kembali ke tanah kepunyaannya sendiri.\n",
          "35:29 Itulah semuanya yang harus menjadi ketetapan hukum bagimu turun-temurun di segala tempat kediamanmu.\n",
          "35:30 Setiap orang yang telah membunuh seseorang haruslah dibunuh sebagai pembunuh menurut keterangan saksi-saksi, tetapi kalau hanya satu orang saksi saja tidak cukup untuk memberi keterangan terhadap seseorang dalam perkara hukuman mati.\n",
          "35:31 Janganlah kamu menerima uang tebusan karena nyawa seorang pembunuh yang kesalahannya setimpal dengan hukuman mati, tetapi pastilah ia dibunuh.\n",
          "35:32 Juga janganlah kamu menerima uang tebusan karena seseorang yang telah melarikan diri ke kota perlindungannya, supaya ia boleh kembali untuk diam di tanahnya sebelum matinya imam besar.\n",
          "35:33 Jadi janganlah kamu mencemarkan negeri tempat tinggalmu, sebab darah itulah yang mencemarkan negeri itu, maka bagi negeri itu tidak dapat diadakan pendamaian oleh karena darah yang tertumpah di sana, kecuali dengan darah orang yang telah menumpahkannya.\n",
          "35:34 Maka janganlah najiskan negeri tempat kedudukanmu, yang di tengah-tengahnya Aku diam, sebab Aku, Tuhan, diam di tengah-tengah orang Israel.\n"
